You can make your own imaged based on another image

Dockerfiles:

    The 'Dockerfile' is the description of your image

Keep track of directory inside and outside image


Dockerfile stuff:

FROM node
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package*.json .    
RUN npm install  // going to run inside the image
COPY . .    //copy the image
EXPOSE 3000 //FOr the port?
CMD [ "npm", "start" ] //Then launch the image

Dockerignore stuff

node_modules //don't need npm
npm-debug.log //don't need npm
.git //no need for git heirarchy


Docker commands:

docker build -t my-app-image . //need docker desktop
docker run -it my-app-image
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 my-app-image
